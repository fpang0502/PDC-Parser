I will fix this to work later as one script file...as for now:

*The text file needs to casedown* (will implement a method doing so)

1) run the raw text file into the pText_Rec.py script which will then create two output files which contain the lines to be parsed and non-parsed


2) use the importSD.py file with the “name”_p_text
	- be sure to have set environmental path to englishPCFG.ser.gz
	- this will create an output text file with the typedDependency data
	- the output files will be created in the current directory that you are
	working in 
	- there will be two files…one being the text file and the other being a pdf
	of the tree

3) next use the sortDepEle.py file with that output text file created by the importSD.py file
