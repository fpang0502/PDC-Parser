README

I will fix this to work later as one script file...as for now:

1) first use the importSD.py file with a text file (the raw_text)
	- be sure to have set environmental path to englishPCFG.ser.gz
	- this will create an output text file with the typedDependency data

2) next use the sortDepEle.py file with that output text file created by the importSD.py file
