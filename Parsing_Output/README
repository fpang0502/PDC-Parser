README

I will fix this to work later as one script file...as for now:

1) first use the importSD.py file with a text file (the raw_text)
	- be sure to have set environmental path to englishPCFG.ser.gz
	- this will create an output text file with the typedDependency data
	- the output files will be created in the current directory that you are 		working in
	- there will be two filesâ€¦one being the text file and the other being a pdf
	of the tree

2) next use the sortDepEle.py file with that output text file created by the importSD.py file
