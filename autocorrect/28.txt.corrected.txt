A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data. This earthquake is located too far inland to generate a tsunami in the Caribbean. 

However-there is the small possibility of a local or regional tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a few hundred kilometers from the earthquake epicenter. Authorities in the region near the epicenter should be made aware of this possibility. 

This will be the only product issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center for this event unless additional information becomes available.
