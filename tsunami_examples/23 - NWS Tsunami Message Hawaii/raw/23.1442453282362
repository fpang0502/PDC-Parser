 STRIKE THE STATE OF HAWAII. HOWEVER...SEA LEVEL CHANGES AND
 STRONG CURRENTS MAY OCCUR ALONG ALL COASTS THAT COULD BE A HAZARD
 TO SWIMMERS AND BOATERS AS WELL AS TO PERSONS NEAR THE SHORE AT
 BEACHES AND IN HARBORS AND MARINAS.  THE THREAT MAY CONTINUE FOR
 SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL WAVE ARRIVAL.
 
 THE ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL OF THE INITIAL WAVE IS
 
                     0311 AM HST THU 17 SEP 2015
 
FURTHER MESSAGES WILL BE ISSUED HOURLY OR SOONER AS CONDITIONS
