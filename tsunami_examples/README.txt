This folder comprises examples of NWS/PTWC tsunami messages.
Each folder has a RAW folder with the actual message from the source and a PARSED folder with what the PDC system extracted from the message.
The files are stamped #.epoch, where # is the source number and epoch is a timestamp in milliseconds since January 01, 1970.

Of the seven 'buckets' for basin reporting, there are two distinct flavors:
 * 24 & 25
 * 21, 22, 23, 28, 29
 
 Refer to the PNG files that highlight problematic areas we've seen throughout the years.
 In general, problems arise becuase of mispellings [puns intended] and unexpected new/removed/changed content.
 
 Not every RAW file is guaranteed to have a PARSED file.
