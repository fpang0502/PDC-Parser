README

Just run the file called “newMain.py”

in terms of working for the other files (i.e. cyclones and volcano) you will need to make a list of tag ordering (look at “printingOutput.py” to see an example of the tsunami tag structure)

*still need to work on a couple more variables of text files… will be finished by friday
