This folder comprises examples of VAAC volcano messages.
The RAW messages are in the .docx file and the PARSED files are stamped #.epoch, where # is the source number and epoch is a timestamp in milliseconds since January 01, 1970.

There are nine different VAACs.  Each can do different things.
In general, problems arise becuase of mispellings [puns intended] and unexpected new/removed/changed content.
 
Not every RAW file is guaranteed to have a PARSED file.
