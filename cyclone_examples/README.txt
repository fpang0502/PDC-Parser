This folder comprises examples of NWS/JTWC tropical cyclone messages.
Each folder has a RAW folder with the actual message from the source and a PARSED folder with what the PDC system extracted from the message.
The files are stamped #.epoch, where # is the source number and epoch is a timestamp in milliseconds since January 01, 1970.

Of the examples, there are two distinct flavors:
 * 31 - 41; NWS
 * 46 - 60; JTWC
 
 Refer to the PNG file that highlights problematic areas we've seen throughout the years for NWS messages.
 The same/similar areas in JTWC messages also cause problems; no PNG provided.
 
 In general, problems arise becuase of mispellings [puns intended] and unexpected new/removed/changed content.
 
 Not every RAW file is guaranteed to have a PARSED file.
