REMARKS:
171500Z POSITION NEAR 25.8S 164.3E.
TROPICAL CYCLONE (TC) 09P (GITA), LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 218 NM SOUTH-
SOUTHWEST OF NOUMEA, NEW CALEDONIA, HAS TRACKED SOUTHWESTWARD AT
10 KNOTS OVER THE PAST SIX HOURS. ANIMATED ENHANCED INFRARED
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A WEAKENING CONVECTIVE STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED
WITH THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER (LLCC) OF TC 09P. DESPITE THE
WEAKENING CONVECTION THE SURFACE WINDS REMAIN STRONG. THE INITIAL
POSITION IS BASED ON A 171126Z METOP-B ASCAT IMAGE WHICH SHOWS A
STRONG AND SYMMETRIC WIND FIELD. THE INITIAL INTENSITY OF 60 KNOTS
HEDGED ABOVE THE AFOREMENTIONED ASCAT IMAGE WHICH SHOWS A LARGE SWATH
OF 50 KNOT WINDS WITH 60 KNOT WINDS LIKELY EMBEDDED BUT NOT DISPLAYED
IN THE ASCAT PASS. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS REVEALS MODERATE VERTICAL
WIND SHEAR (15 TO 20 KNOTS) WHICH IS STILL OFFSET BY A ROBUST
POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL. SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES REMAIN FAVORABLE
FOR THE TIME BEING, BETWEEN 26 AND 27 DEGREES CELSIUS. TC 09P IS
TRACKING SOUTHWESTWARD ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN EDGE OF A SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE (STR) LOCATED TO THE SOUTHEAST. TC 09P WILL ROUND THE WESTERN
EDGE OF THE STR AND BEGIN TO TRACK SOUTHWARD BY TAU 30, WITH AN
INTENSITY OF 50 KNOTS. TC 09P WILL THEN TRACK SOUTHEASTWARD AS IT
ACCELERATES AND BEGINS EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION BY TAU 72. TC 09P
WILL MAKE LANDFALL IN NEW ZEALAND NEAR TAU 84 AND COMPLETE
EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION BY TAU 96. DYNAMIC MODEL GUIDANCE IS STILL
IN GOOD AGREEMENT, THEREFORE, THERE IS HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE JTWC
FORECAST TRACK. MAXIMUM SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT AT 171200Z IS 28
FEET. NEXT WARNINGS AT 172100Z, 180300Z, 180900Z AND 181500Z.//
