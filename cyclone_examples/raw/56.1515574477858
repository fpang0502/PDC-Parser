REMARKS:
100900Z POSITION NEAR 28.9S 68.6E.
TROPICAL CYCLONE 04S (IRVING), LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 753 NM
SOUTHEAST OF PORT LOUIS, MAURITIUS, HAS TRACKED SOUTH-
SOUTHWESTWARD AT 22 KNOTS OVER THE PAST SIX HOURS. ANIMATED
MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTS A RAPIDLY WEAKENING SYSTEM
WITH A FULLY EXPOSED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION CENTER (LLCC) AND WEAK
CONVECTIVE BANDING CONFINED TO THE SOUTHERN SEMICIRCLE. THERE IS
HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE INITIAL POSITION BASED ON THE EXPOSED LLCC.
THE INITIAL INTENSITY IS ASSESSED AT 45 KNOTS WHICH IS BASED ON
CURRENT INTENSITY DVORAK ESTIMATES RANGING FROM T2.5 TO T3.0 (35 TO
45 KNOTS) AND A 100332Z OSCAT IMAGE SHOWING A SOLID REGION OF 4O
KNOTS TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE LLCC. UPPER-LEVEL ANALYSIS SHOWS A
STRONG POLEWARD OUTFLOW CHANNEL FEEDING INTO THE MID-LATITUDE JET
WITH WIND SHEAR STARTING INCREASE. TC 04S IS TRACKING EXPEDITIOUSLY
AT 22 KNOTS ALONG THE WESTERN BOUNDARY OF A DEEP-LAYERED SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE TO THE EAST. OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS TC 04S WILL ACCELERATE TO
THE SOUTHEAST AROUND THE RIDGE AXIS AND INTO A FAST APPROACHING
LONGWAVE TROUGH AND BEGIN TRANSITIONING INTO A BAROCLINIC SYSTEM. TC
04S WILL RAPIDLY COMPLETE ETT BY TAU 36. DYNAMIC MODEL GUIDANCE
SHOWS VERY TIGHT GROUPING AND OVERALL AGREEMENT, LENDING HIGH
CONFIDENCE TO THE FORECAST TRACK. MAXIMUM SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT AT
100600Z IS 25 FEET. NEXT WARNINGS AT 101500Z, 102100Z, 110300Z AND
110900Z. REFER TO TROPICAL CYCLONE 05S (FIVE) WARNINGS (WTXS33 PGTW)
FOR SIX-HOURLY UPDATES.//
