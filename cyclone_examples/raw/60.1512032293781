REMARKS:
300900Z POSITION NEAR 8.0N 76.2E.
TROPICAL CYCLONE 03B (THREE), LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 927 NM NORTH-
NORTHEAST OF DIEGO GARCIA, HAS TRACKED WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AT 08
KNOTS OVER THE PAST SIX HOURS. ANIMATED MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE
IMAGERY DEPICTS INCREASING CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH TC
03B AS IT BECOMES MORE SYMMETRIC AROUND THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION
CENTER (LLCC). THE INITIAL POSITION IS PLACED WITH HIGH CONFIDENCE
BASED ON A 300429Z AMSU 89GHZ MICROWAVE IMAGE. THE INITIAL INTENSITY
OF 50 KNOTS IS BASED ON DVORAK ESTIMATES OF T3.0 (45 KNOTS) FROM KNES
AND T3.5 (55 KNOTS) FROM PGTW. TC 03B IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE
TRACKING TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AROUND THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY
OF A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE LOCATED OVER INDIA. VERTICAL WIND SHEAR IS
MODERATE (15 TO 20 KNOTS). BOTH POLEWARD AND EQUATORWARD OUTFLOW ARE
GOOD. SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE FAVORABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT (29 TO
30 DEGREES CELSIUS). TC 03B WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN IN THE SHORT
TERM REACHING AN INTENSITY OF 75 KNOTS BY TAU 36.  AS THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN, TC 03B WILL BEGIN TO MAKE A NORTHERLY
TURN.  BEYOND TAU 72, TC 03B WILL ENCOUNTER INCREASED WIND SHEAR AND
WILL DECREASE IN INTENSITY.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HWRF, NUMERICAL
MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT LENDING TO HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE
JTWC FORECAST TRACK. MAXIMUM SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT AT 300600Z IS 14
FEET. NEXT WARNINGS AT 301500Z, 302100Z, 010300Z AND 010900Z.//
